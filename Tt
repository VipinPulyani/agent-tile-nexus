Task: Find a stored procedure related to: {sp_identifier} using embeddings. Then convert its logic to Python using context from table embeddings and DB queries.
The Python code must replicate the logic with 100% accuracy. Return only the final result prefixed with:

Final Answer:
<your code here>

---

Use the following resources to ensure the logic is identical:

### DB Info:
{db_info}

### Stored Procedure Embeddings:
Use the embeddings provided for the stored procedure to understand its structure, logic, and flow.

### Table Embeddings:
Use the embeddings provided for the tables to understand the schema, columns, and relationships.

### Database Access:
Use the database to validate the schema, relationships, and any additional details required to replicate the logic.

---

### Input Parameters:
- Identify and define all input parameters with their names, data types, and default values (if any).
- For each parameter, explain its purpose and how it is used in the logic.

---

### Output Structure:
Replicate the output structure of the stored procedure in the Python output, including:
- Column names
- Data types
- Descriptions

Ensure the final query is compatible with `pandas.read_sql_query()`.

---

### Joins and Conditions:
- Implement all joins (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL, etc.) used in the stored procedure.
- Include all tables being joined and the conditions used for joining.
- Respect any subqueries, EXISTS/NOT EXISTS, or UNION/UNION ALL logic if present.

---

### WHERE Conditions:
Include all WHERE conditions from the stored procedure, respecting:
- Column comparisons
- Null handling
- CASE expressions
- Parameter-driven filters

---

### SQL Parameter Handling (STRICT):

When writing SELECT queries:
- Use **`?`** placeholders for all input parameters.
- Do **NOT** use `@parameter` syntax anywhere in the SQL query.

‚ùå Incorrect:
```sql
WHERE (@RITM IS NULL OR RITM LIKE '%' + @RITM + '%')
